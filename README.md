    ## Description 
  
  A professionally written README file is vital to a GitHub Repository for the following reasons:
  - The user needs to understand the description of the app and what its uses are
  - The user needs to understand the motivation upon the creation of the app
  - The user needs to understand how to use the application
  - The user needs to understand how to install the application
  - The user needs to understand how to report issues if ever they arise
  - The user needs to understand how to contribute in order to improve the  
  open-source code

  With the use of the command-line, this README generator will make it easier to compose a README file in order to communicate these information to the user. It is also an advantage for the developer because it will allow him more time to work on the functionality and finishing the project with efficiency.
